  - âœ… Position and capital management - respects exposure limits

  4. API Model Integration (src/api_models.py):
  - âœ… Market, Rewards, Token models matching Polymarket API structure
  - âœ… Dynamic reward parameters - min order size and max spread per market
  - âœ… Proper data structures for reward rates and market metadata

  ðŸ”§ Key Features Implemented:

  Smart Market Selection:
  # Find markets with high rewards, low competition, manageable capital requirements
  screener = PolymarketScreener(client, ScreeningCriteria(
      min_daily_rewards=Decimal("50"),      # $50+ daily rewards
      max_competition_density=Decimal("0.6"), # <60% competition 
      min_spread_budget=Decimal("0.02")     # 2c+ spread available
  ))
  opportunities = screener.find_opportunities(max_markets=100)

  Risk-Managed Strategy:
  # Configure strategy for safe liquidity provision
  config = LiquidityProvisionConfig(
      optimal_distance_from_midpoint=Decimal("0.015"), # 1.5c safe distance
      volatility_exit_threshold=Decimal("0.02"),        # 2% volatility exit
      enable_yes_no_hedging=True,                       # Auto-hedging
      order_refresh_interval_minutes=30                 # FIFO management
  )

  Automated Hedging:
  # When YES order fills at price p, automatically hedge with NO order at (1-p)
  hedge_orders = strategy.calculate_hedge_orders(filled_order, yes_orderbook, no_orderbook)
