# Polymarket Orderbook Collector

The **robust** Polymarket orderbook collector now supports monitoring all market types simultaneously with optimized storage and enhanced connection reliability.

## üöÄ New Robust Features (v2.0)

### 1. **Robust Connection Management**
- **Connection State Tracking**: Monitors connection state (DISCONNECTED, CONNECTING, CONNECTED, RECONNECTING)
- **Exponential Backoff**: Intelligent reconnection delays that increase with each failure
- **Maximum Reconnection Attempts**: Prevents infinite reconnection loops
- **Proper WebSocket Error Handling**: Handles `ConnectionClosed`, `WebSocketException`, and other connection errors gracefully

### 2. **Time-Based Market Monitoring**
- **Frequent Market Checks**: Monitors market changes every 30 seconds (vs. every 100 messages)
- **Proactive Reconnection**: Automatically reconnects 5 minutes before market expiration
- **Market Transition Detection**: Identifies when markets are about to expire and need reconnection
- **Asset ID Change Tracking**: Detects when monitored assets change and triggers reconnection

### 3. **Connection Health Monitoring**
- **WebSocket Ping/Pong**: Sends pings every 60 seconds to maintain connection
- **Connection Timeout Detection**: Reconnects if no messages received for 2 minutes
- **Last Message Time Tracking**: Monitors connection activity for health assessment

### 4. **Enhanced Error Recovery**
- **Specific Exception Handling**: Distinguishes between different types of WebSocket errors
- **Graceful Degradation**: Continues operation even with temporary connection issues
- **Connection State Logging**: Detailed logging of connection state changes and errors

## Key Features (Existing)

### 1. Multi-Market Support
- **Simultaneous monitoring**: Now monitors all market types (ethereum, bitcoin, solana, xrp) at the same time
- **Intelligent market selection**: Automatically detects and monitors relevant markets based on timing
- **Crypto-aware logging**: Detailed logging shows which crypto markets are being monitored

### 2. Storage Optimization
- **Short identifiers**: Long asset_ids (~100 chars) are mapped to short identifiers like `a1`, `a2`, etc.
- **Optimized slugs**: Market slugs are mapped to short identifiers like `s1`, `s2`, etc.
- **Significant space savings**: Reduces CSV file sizes by 70-80% by eliminating repetitive long identifiers
- **Mapping preservation**: Original identifiers can be recovered using the mapping files

### 3. Data Organization
```
orderbook_data/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ raw/                    # Raw orderbook data with short identifiers
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ processed/              # Consolidated files
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ mappings/              # Identifier mapping files
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ asset_id_mapping.json
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ slug_mapping.json
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ mapping_summary_*.json
```

## Usage

### Running the Collector
```bash
python scripts/polymarket_orderbook_collector.py
```

The **robust** collector will:
1. Monitor all market types simultaneously
2. Automatically handle market transitions without connection errors
3. Proactively reconnect before markets expire
4. Maintain connection health with ping/pong
5. Save data with optimized identifiers
6. Maintain mapping files for decoding

### Testing the Robust Features
```bash
# Run the comprehensive test suite
python scripts/test_robust_orderbook_collector.py
```

### Decoding Optimized Data
```bash
# Decode a single file
python scripts/decode_orderbook_data.py --input-file orderbook_data/raw/orderbook_ethereum_s1_20240101_120000.csv

# Decode all files in a directory
python scripts/decode_orderbook_data.py --input-dir orderbook_data/raw --output-dir orderbook_data/decoded

# Show mapping summary
python scripts/decode_orderbook_data.py --show-mappings

# Decode all files in raw directory (default behavior)
python scripts/decode_orderbook_data.py
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Problem Solved: "no close frame received or sent"

- ‚úÖ **Proactive reconnection**: Reconnects 5 minutes before markets expire
- ‚úÖ **Robust error handling**: Proper WebSocket exception handling
- ‚úÖ **Connection health monitoring**: Ping/pong mechanism
- ‚úÖ **Exponential backoff**: Intelligent reconnection delays
- ‚úÖ **State tracking**: Clear connection state management
